Co-founded and won GovHack Brussels with a governance platform that consolidates fragmented DAO proposal information into a unified interface. Now serving major DAOs including Arbitrum, the platform processes millions of votes and thousands of proposals across multiple blockchains.

<br></br>

Led the technical architecture of a modular platform built with Rust and Next.js, implementing specialized services for blockchain indexing, forum synchronization, and intelligent proposal mapping using LLM embeddings. The system automatically links related content across Discourse forums, Snapshot polls, and on-chain votes, solving the critical problem of governance information fragmentation.

<br></br>

Designed and operate a high-availability infrastructure across three geographically distributed datacenters, achieving 99% uptime through automatic failover, service discovery with Consul, and container orchestration with Nomad. The bare-metal deployment ensures complete control over the stack with local-first performance through read replicas in each region.

<br></br>

Open-sourced the entire codebase and infrastructure playbooks, embodying the philosophy that governance infrastructure should be as decentralized as the DAOs it serves. This enables any DAO to self-host their own instance and truly own their governance.
