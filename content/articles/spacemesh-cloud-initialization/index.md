# Celebrating a milestone

Hey there! I've got some really exciting news to share with you. The team at [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io) has successfully launched their main net! ðŸš€ It's quite the achievement, and I'm genuinely thrilled for them.

The memorable date was July 14th, a day that marked a significant milestone in their journey. It's the result of the Spacemesh team's perseverance and their tireless dedication to their project.

Their commitment to their vision is truly impressive and with the main net now operational, the future certainly looks promising for Spacemesh!

# Now what?

Now that the genesis event is over, we have around 10 days to set up our PoST data before the first round starts, as explained in the [genesis timeline](https://spacemesh.io/blog/genesis-timeline/).

Data setup is the hard part of the Proof of Space and Time algorithm used by Spacemesh.

And it's really hard. While you can generate PoST data on most systems, it works best with a GPU, and a powerful one at that.

But here's the problem... I don't have a GPU. I only have a MacBook M2 and it's not fast enough for data setup. It's not just slow, but I can't keep it running non-stop until it's done, which could take weeks. So I had to come up with a different solution.

# Cloud GPU ?

_Before going further, please be aware of the following risks_:

- _You will enter your passphrase in a cloud instance. Basically, someone's else computer. This is vulnerable to MITM attacks!_
- _We will use [this](https://github.com/selkies-project/docker-nvidia-glx-desktop) docker image for our environment. This is vulnerable to supply chain attacks!_
- _Basically, you're trusting runpod to run a virtual machine for you, configured by some guy on GitHub, with instructions given by me, not look at what you're doing inside that virtual machine and then delete all the data after you're done._

_Risky stuff. Got it? Cool, let's get back to the topic._

Enter [runpod](runpod.io).

Runpod is a platform for renting GPU power or offering your own GPU to be used by someone else. If you're not into that whole community thing, they also have their own GPUs and their pricing is pretty good.

After some _very primitive_ tests, I found out that RTX 4090 can generate around 20GB of PoST data per hour.

That puts us at around 0.03$ / GB or around 30$ worth of GPU computing power for every TB.

Keep in mind, this is a very innaccurate estimate. I suggest you to try it out for yourself with the minimum 256GB PoST first.

# The actual guide

- Make an account on runpod.io. Duh.
- Runpod runs using prepaid credits, so you have to put some money in [here](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/billing).

- Create the template which we will use later

  - Under _My Templates_, create a _New Template_ using these settings

    - Template name: whatever floats your boat man
    - Container image: **ghcr.io/selkies-project/nvidia-glx-desktop:latest**
    - Container Disk: **5 GB**
    - Volume Disk: **1050GB**

      _This is the size of the volume which will be used for PoST data generation. In this case, we will generate 1TB of data, so this is just a bit bigger than that._

    - Volume Mount Path: **/home/user/post**

      _This is the default path Spacemesh App uses for PoST data generation, so to make our life easier, this is where we mount the volume as well._

    - Expose HTTP Ports: **8080,**

      _This will be used for our remote connection inside the VM._

    - Expose TCP Ports: **20,**

      _Just in case you need to ssh into it._

    - Environment Variables

      _These are very important, so make sure you get them right. The position in the table does not matter, but the values do!_

      **PASSWD - whatever password you want**

      **NOVNC_ENABLE - true**

      **NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES - true**

Once you're done, it should look more or less like this

- Save the template. Duh.

- Go to _Secure Cloud_ and _Deploy_ a _RTX 4090_ instance. **Make sure you use the template you created before, in my case, _sm-nvidia-glx-desktop_.**
