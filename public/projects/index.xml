      <description>Senate is an infrastructure tool made for governance teams and delegates which aims to help you never forget to vote on a proposal ever again.
It does so by giving you access to a dashboard which includes all the new proposals of the DAOs you follow.
To increase your visibility as a delegator, it as well allows you to view and share your past votes.
Future plans include notifications across a variety of channels, like Discord, Telegram or EPNS.</description>
